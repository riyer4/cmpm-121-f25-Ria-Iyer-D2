# CMPM 121 D2 Project

I was able to implement a "Sticker Sketchpad" concept through the D2 documentation that tracks the users cursor and makes the drawing accordingly by following objects such as drag and display. There are currently five buttons, clear, undo, redo, thin marker, and thick marker, that each have their own eventListenrs and logic that follow.
